# Verify SDL installation

This repository contains a minimal SDL project for verifying the SDL installation.

## Requirements

you will need make, c-compiler, and sdl2 included in your library path.

Below is a script to install dependencies on a debian-like system

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev
```

## Build

```bash
make build
```

_Note: This installation was verified on Windows with WSL2_
